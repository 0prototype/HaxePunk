# HaxePunk
A HaXe port of the [FlashPunk](http://flashpunk.net) AS3 library.

## Compilation
There are two methods you can use to compile HaxePunk. Make sure you have Haxe 2.07 or higher.

### FlashDevelop
Use the HaxePunk.hxproj file to start your project. It has assets already setup and a Main class to get you started.

### Command line compilation
You will need to download SamHaXe to compile the assets file. Then just run `make` and everything should compile.

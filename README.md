# HaxePunk
A HaXe port of the [FlashPunk](http://flashpunk.net) AS3 library.

## Compilation
First, make sure you have [HaXe](http://haxe.org) 2.07 or higher. You will need to also install [NME](http://haxenme.org) 3.2 or higher. The last step is to install HaxePunk through haxelib. You can also clone the GitHub project but there is more to setup if you do it that way.

    haxelib install HaxePunk
    haxelib run HaxePunk new MyProject # creates a project
